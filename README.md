## Project Team Members
- Shreya kola
- Christina Burgess

## Development Environment/Language Details
- **Language:** Swift
- **IDE:** Xcode (version X.X) and replit.it
- **Operating System:** macOS (version 5.10)

## Organization of Code Files in the GitHub Repo
- 'Hello world': A simple hello world program that prints the string "Hello world".
- 'Firstname, Lastname': This code takes a first name and a last name, concatenates them, removes any whitespace, and then sorts and displays the resulting name in various orders.
- `SixLittleWords.swift`: Main Swift file containing the implementation of the Six Little Words puzzle.

## Issues Encountered During Development
- Mostly the syntax due to us not being familiar with swift code since its so different from rest of the programming languages we have used in the past for personal and course projects.
